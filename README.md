# recode
This repository contains the recoded artwork devolped during February 2018 in p5.js as part of the class [Introduction to Creative Coding using p5.js](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/programacion_creativa_p5js) which will be held on March 2018, in Santaigo de Chile. This repo is inspired by the [ReCode Project](http://recodeproject.com/) and the Recreating the Past, class taught by [Zach Lieberman](https://github.com/ofZach) in [SFPC](http://sfpc.io/).<br>
The recoded artwork was chosen in order to achieve the class topics.
